# Github Battle

This repo is just my output from following https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals

The tutorial itself isn't ES6 on purpose so I'm ES6ifying it as I go along (using create-react-app as a base) and using React Router V4 too which is why my progress is super slow since it's learning a new API and what not rather than just following directly along with the videos

Also, I ran into some trouble passing props from the router down but I don't know if that's a thing where React Router V4 doesn't directly support passing props to routes anymore?

This whole thing is confusing but I'll probably figure it out and clean it all up.

I'm also cross referencing with Wes Bos's React for Beginners at points because that's actually ES6 but the output is different. This is arguably a smaller project and actually has networking in the form of fetching from Github which is something I couldn't find much with React guides.
